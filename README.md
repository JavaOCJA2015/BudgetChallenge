# BudgetChallenge
Repo for all team apps for the budget coding challenge

The Spec : 

The client has requested that we create an income & expense tracker for families to use on their desktop machines.

The application should allow users the specify the size of their family, how many of which are earners and non-earners.

After specifying the number of earners the family has, the user is then prompted to enter in how much money that earner generates. They can either enter in a yearly salary or an hourly rate along with hours worked in a week, and specify whether or not it is before or after taxes, if it is before taxes you must calculate their after taxes amount.

After adding up all of the families total income you must then allow the user to add their expenses, weekly amount spent on food, utility bills (tv/phone/mobile/internet) along with optional gym membership options and such. In short anything that is a reoccurring expense either weekly or monthly

After taking in both total income and total expenses you must then calculate how much spare money is left over for the family to spend recreationally or to save.

The application should have a GUI with appropriate forms to fill out for each of the details the user has to input. Along with a neat overview of currently added family members with the options to view their details and edit them if a mistake was made upon input. You should store the family member's name and role in the family (daughter/son/mother/father etc). The GUI should be as simple to navigate as possible with the amount of clicks to perform a certain task being a consideration as users will want to click as little as possible to do get to where they wish to navigate to.

The application should be able to generate reports displaying the total incomes after taxes then showing the expenses being deducted each of which properly labelled and easy to read. The program should allow to user to choose whether they want the reports generated on a weekly basis or a monthly basis or even yearly, or optionally a combination of two.
The reports need to be stored in a txt file or optionally get fancy and use a .pdf file, but .txt is fine.

The application should be tested thoroughly and free of all bugs and crashes

Additional Requirements : 
The application should allow the user to specify the tax rates in their countries for the different tax brackets. The Application should allow the user to specify what country/region they live in. 

The application should display the appropriate currency symbol for the region selected by the user. The application should allow the user to choose a colour scheme of the different colours used in the GUI via an options window. 

The application should be able to store the family information into a separate file to the generated reports and then be able to open files that contain family information, allowing the user to choose which file is opened so that they can load in previous saved data. The application should be able to compare one family's income and expenses to another family.
